# premierleague-table
open source premier league table

link to project: does not exist

I'm still working on getting the API data into my server and then into my table every time the page loads.



*What did I learn?*

-basics of javascript
-what I don't know
-the more time I put in, the more I will learn
-one step at a time (use project plan)
-API keys


*Challenges and lessons learned:*

-APIs are harder than they look (for me)
-not focusing on one thing (I should've moved beyond the API)
-express scares me
-not everything you can do on the backend works on the client side


*What's to come:*

-autopopulated data
-favorite team marking
-expandable rows including scheduled games, team form and more
